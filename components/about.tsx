          I’m Tamer, a designer and frontend developer with over 15 years of experience helping businesses bring ideas
          to life. I specialize in UI/UX design and React-based development, with a strong focus on SaaS products and
          Travel Tech platforms. Based in Turkey, I work remotely across Europe and align easily with CET/EET time
          zones. My approach is simple: clear communication, fast delivery, and designs that not only look great but
          also work seamlessly. Currently, I’m open to full-time remote roles as well as select freelance
          collaborations.
